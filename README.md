## ðŸ’« What I'm currently working on!
I am currently working on a personal project, where I am migrating my personal application from PaaS to IaaS using Docker as a containerization tool, to regain control over configurations and security. This includes the assessment of existing infrastructure, planning, and data migration. Using Docker in the new IaaS environment provides several benefits such as increased scalability, flexibility, and maintainability of the application, as well as easier management and deployment of the application. Additionally, Docker allows for better isolation and security of the application, by running it in a containerized environment.
